## Project Description
  The project provides a user with the ability to select a movie, actors for the movie, a production team and add production members.  MVP goals are

  users to comment on.

  **Technologies used:** 
    - Django authentication to allow the user to log in and create user unique entries.
    - Django web framework for the structure of the application
    - Postgresql to store user login information, movies, actors, production team and MVP feature poster images
    - Python programming language and libraries to create the project
    - HTML with embedded Django to create dynamic content
    - CSS and Bootstrap CSS library to style pages
    - Javascript
